"""step_recognize.py — recover a featuretree IR from a STEP B-rep (feature RECOGNITION).

A STEP file is a dumb B-rep: geometry, no feature tree. You cannot *convert* it to an IR;
you can only *infer* one. The insight this leans on: **most machined/printed parts are a 2D
profile EXTRUDED along some axis, or REVOLVED about one** (plus holes). So the core intelligence
is CROSS-SECTIONAL. recognize() tries both:
  * EXTRUDE — find the axis the solid is a prismatic extrusion along (every face is
    planar-perpendicular, planar-parallel, or a cylinder parallel to it), rotate it onto Z, and
    recover the profile + through/blind holes. Orientation-agnostic (X/Y/Z or any face normal).
  * REVOLVE — find the axis the solid is unchanged under rotation about (a body of revolution),
    take the MERIDIAN (a half-plane section through the axis) as the profile, emit revolve(360).
Profiles may have straight edges AND circular arcs (DXF bulge).

MULTI-AXIS RECOVERY closes real machined parts that no single extrude/revolve can: when the base
extrude doesn't verify, the residual (base − original) is carved feature by feature. Every leftover
lump is itself a 2D profile extruded along ITS OWN axis — a floor / through-web pocket along the
main axis, a cross-hole perpendicular to it — so each is recognized and subtracted as a `prism_cut`
(a placed profile-along-an-axis), looping until the residual vanishes. On the NIST CTC-01 test part
this takes a 155%-off base extrude to a verified reconstruction, leaving only the edge chamfers.

The honesty comes from SELF-VERIFICATION: the recognized IR is re-emitted through b3d_emit and its
volume + (rotation-tolerant) bounding box are compared to the original STEP. Several axes can look
prismatic, so recognize() gathers a candidate per axis and lets verification pick the winner — first
a base that verifies on its own, else the first whose recovery verifies. Every result is either
"verified" (provably the same solid within tolerance, Δvol≈0) or PARTIAL with the residual reported.
Out of scope (surfaced as residual, never silently wrong): edge fillets/chamfers, additive bosses,
lofts/sweeps/freeform, and profiles whose boundary has splines/ellipses (lines + circular arcs only).
