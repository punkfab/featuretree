"""ir.py — a neutral, named feature-tree IR (a small CAD DSL).

The operation-preserving representation that no neutral *file* format provides: a
declarative, ordered list of named features with named parameters. It is the single
source of truth; per-target emitters (FreeCAD here) translate it into that tool's
*native* feature vocabulary, so the tree shows up editable on the left.

Design choices that make round-trip tractable:
  * every feature has a stable, human-meaningful `name` (-> the target object's Label)
    so a human edit can be matched back by name, not by kernel edge id;
  * parameters are named values, not positions in a blob;
  * geometry is referenced symbolically (a feature name + plane / a query), never by
    unstable kernel edge/face ids — the wall that kills neutral feature files.

Scope: sketches (rectangles, circles, AND arbitrary polygons/profiles-with-holes) on
principal planes or face-attached, Pad, Pocket (through/depth), Fillet (edge query).
Plain JSON-able dicts, so the IR crosses cleanly into FreeCAD's own Python (3.11).
